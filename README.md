# CANController
### This is a KiCAD file for a PCB that converts the serial bus data from sensors to CAN bus data which are passed through DB15 connectors and VGA cables to other similar PCBs (other board schematics can be found in different repositories on github.com/roboticsteam4904).
It also functions as the controller and power for 3 pin LED strips.
